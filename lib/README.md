# Dosepix readout application for bluetooth devices
written by Sebastian Schmidt  

## TODO-List
- If connection to a device is lost, data acquisition stops. Try to 
  keep reconnecting and continue the acquisition process.
- If bluetooth connection is disabled, display warning if all measurements 
  should be stopped. If connection is enabled again, reconnect devices and
  proceed with acquisition.
- Stop acquisition of a user by long-tapping on the corresponding chart. 
  Feature is already implemented but does not work with the used flchart.
